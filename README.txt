The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle described as a television 
gameshow.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem for a more detailed 
description of the problem.


    "Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: 
     Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say 
     No. 1 [but the door is not opened], and the host, who knows what's behind 
     the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says 
     to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to 
     switch your choice?"
     -- wikipedia
     

This program runs many simulations of the Monty Hall game show, and keeps a
running score of the results for two 'policies' - namely 'stick' or 'switch'.

Although the reasoning of the Monty Hall problem may be counter intuitive, the 
simulation shows a clear advantage of one policy over the other...

To run the program, just run the gameRunner.py file.
